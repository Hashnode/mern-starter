MERN is a scaffolding tool which makes it easy to build isomorphic apps using Mongo, Express, React and NodeJS. It minimises the setup time and gets you up to speed using proven technologies.

## Quickstart

```
  npm install -g mern-cli
  mern init your_new_app
  cd your_new_app
  npm install
  npm start
```

**Note : Please make sure your MongoDB is running.** For MongoDB installation guide see [this](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/installation/).

## File Structure

### Webpack Configs

MERN uses Webpack for bundling modules. There are three types of Webpack configs provided `webpack.config.dev.js` (for development), `webpack.config.prod.js` (for production) and `webpack.config.server.js` (for bundling server in production).

The Webpack configuration is minimal and beginner-friendly. You can customise and add more features to it for production build.

### Server

MERN uses express web framework. Our app sits in server.js where we check for NODE_ENV.

If NODE_ENV is development, we apply Webpack middlewares for bundling and Hot Module Replacement.

#### Server Side Rendering

We use React Router's match function for handling all page requests so that browser history works.

All the routes are defined in `client/routes.js`. React Router renders components according to route requested.

```js
// Server Side Rendering based on routes matched by React-router.
app.use((req, res) => {
    match({
        routes,
        location: req.url
    }, (err, redirectLocation, renderProps) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(500).end('Internal server error');
        }

        if (!renderProps) {
            return res.status(404).end('Not found!');
        }

        const initialState = {
            posts: [],
            post: {}
        };

        const store = configureStore(initialState);

        fetchComponentData(store.dispatch, renderProps.components, renderProps.params).then(() => {
            const initialView = renderToString(
                <Provider store = {store} >
                  <RouterContext {...renderProps}/>
                </Provider>
            );

            const finalState = store.getState();

            res.status(200).end(renderFullPage(initialView, finalState));
        }).catch(() => {
            res.end(renderFullPage('Error', {}));
        });
    });
});
```

`match` takes two parameters, first is an object that contains routes, location and history and second is a callback function which is called when routes have been matched to a location.

If there's an error in matching we return 500 status code, if no matches are found we return 404 status code. If a match is found then, we need to create a new Redux Store instance.

**Note:** A new Redux Store has populated afresh on every request.

`fetchComponentData` is the essential function. It takes three params: first is a dispatch function of Redux store, the second is an array of components that should be rendered in current route and third is the route params. `fetchComponentData` collects all the needs (need is an array of actions that are required to be dispatched before rendering the component) of components in the current route. It returns a promise when all the required actions are dispatched. We render the page and send data to the client for client-side rendering in `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.

### Client

Client directory contains all the shared components, routes, modules.

#### components
This folder contains all the common components which are used throughout the project.

#### index.js
Index.js simply does client side rendering using the data provided from `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.

#### assets
All the assets images, fonts goes here. All of these will be copied to `dist` folder while running in production and served from there.

#### modules
Modules are the way of organising different domain-specific modules in the project. A typical module contains the following
```
| - Post
  | - __tests__ // all the tests for this module goes here
      | - components // Sub components of this module
          | - Post.spec.js
          | - PostList.spec.js
          | - PostItem.spec.js
          | - PostImage.spec.js
      | - pages
          | - PostPage.spec.js
          | - PostViewPage.spec.js
      | - PostReducer.spec.js
      | - PostActions.spec.js
  | - components // Sub components of this module
      | - Post.js
      | - PostList.js
      | - PostItem.js
      | - PostImage.js
  | - pages // React Router Pages from this module
      | - PostPage
          | - PostPage.js
          | - PostPage.css
      | - PostViewPage
          | - PostViewPage.js
          | - PostViewPage.css
  | - PostReducer.js
  | - PostActions.js
```

## Misc

### ES6 support
We use babel to transpile code in both server and client with `stage-0` plugin. So, you can use both ES6 and experimental ES7 features.

### Make your MERN
In this version, we enabled the `mern-cli` to clone not only this project but also the variants of `mern-starter` like one project with MaterialUI or JWT auth. To make your version of MERN, follow these steps

1. Clone this project
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-starter
    ```

2. Make your changes. Add a package, add authentication, modify the file structure, replace Redux with MobX or anything else.

3. In this version, we also added code generators. Blueprints for those generators are located at `config/blueprints`, and config is located at `mern.json`. Make sure to edit them if necessary after your made modifications in the previous step. There is a section below which explains how to modify generators.

4. Next clone `mern-cli` project
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-cli
    ```

5. Add your project details to `variants.json` in the cloned project and send a pull request.

### Modifying Generators

#### mern.json
It contains a blueprints array. Each object in it is the config for a generator. A blueprint config contains the name, description, usage, and files array. An example blueprint config
```
{
  "name": "dumb-s",
  "description": "Generates a dumb react component in shared components",
  "usage": "dumb-s [component-name]",
  "files": [
    {
      "blueprint-path": "config/blueprints/dumb-component.ejs",
      "target-path": "client/components/<%= helpers.capitalize(name) %>.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

A file object contains

1. `blueprint-path` - location of the blueprint file

2. `target-path` - location where the file should be generated

3. `parent-path` - optional parameter, used if you want to generate the file inside an already existing folder in your project.

Also, `target-path` supports [ejs](https://github.com/mde/ejs) and the following variables will be passed while rendering,

1. `name` - `<component-name>` input from user

2. `parent` - in particular special cases where you need to generate files inside an already existing folder, you can obtain this parent variable from the user. A config using that will look like,
    ```
    {
      "name": "dumb-m",
      "description": "Generates a dumb react component in a module directory",
      "usage": "dumb-m <module-name>/<component-name>",
      "files": [
        {
          "blueprint-path": "config/blueprints/dumb-component.ejs",
          "parent-path": "client/modules/<%= helpers.capitalize(parent) %>",
          "target-path": "components/<%= helpers.capitalize(name) %>/<%= helpers.capitalize(name) %>.js"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    Here, notice the usage. In `<module-name>/<component-name>`, `<module-name>` will be passed as `parent` and `<component-name>` will be passed as `<name>`.

3. `helpers` - an helper object is passed which include common utility functions. For now, it contains `capitalize`. If you want to add more, send a PR to [mern-cli](https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-cli).

#### Blueprint files
Blueprints are basically [ejs](https://github.com/mde/ejs) templates which are rendered with the same three variables(`name`, optional `parent` and `helpers` object) as above.
